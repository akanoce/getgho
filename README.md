## üõ†Ô∏è Run the Project

#### Generate the required api keys

Create a new `.env` from template using

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Generate the required api keys for the sepolia network from

https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps
https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in

and insert them in the new `.env`

```
VITE_ALCHEMY_KEY=
VITE_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=
```

### Setting up Turnkey

The first step is to set up your Turnkey organization and account. By following the [Quickstart](https://docs.turnkey.com/getting-started/quickstart) guide, you should have:

-   A public/private API key pair for Turnkey
-   An organization ID

Once you've gathered these values, add them to a new `.env.local` file. Notice that your API private key should be securely managed and **_never_** be committed to git.

```bash
$ cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Now open `.env.local` and add the missing environment variables:

-   `VITE_API_PUBLIC_KEY`
-   `VITE_API_PRIVATE_KEY`
-   `VITE_TURNKEY_API_BASE_URL`
-   `VITE_ORGANIZATION_ID`

#### Run the project

```
yarn dev
```
